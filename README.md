## What is A.R.P. you ask?
**A.R.P.** is a classless, aptitude based system.



Your character will be formed by their experiences and adapt in suite, just as is the nature of conciseness.
Once the generic mechanics are ironed out, the first release of ARP will be comprised fantasy themed modules as that is what I will be playtesting with my group first.
Sci-fi Settings, skills, specialties, weapons, builds, and new mechanics will be developed, play-tested, and released once the fantasy modules are functional and edited.
This alpha build of the rules is more of a framework for playtesting than a finalized set of rules. The basic game mechanics are made, but the scale and balance of the rules are in need of development.
My aim is for this to be an open, community generated system.
We will take suggestions, pull requests, and even forks/deviations of this system very seriously in relation to further development.
