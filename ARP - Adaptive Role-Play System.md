# Adaptive Role-Play System
## _The A.R.P. System_



ARP is a classless, aptitude based system.


Your character will be formed by their experiences and adapt in suite, just as is the nature of conciseness. Once the generic mechanics are ironed out, the first release of ARP will be comprised fantasy themed modules as that is what I will be playtesting with my group first. Sci-fi Settings, skills, specialties, weapons, builds, and new mechanics will be developed, playtested, and released once the fantasy modules are functional and edited. This alpha build of the rules is more of a framework for playtesting than a finalized set of rules. The basic game mechanics are made, but the scale and balance of the rules are in need of development. Soon, this alpha will be released on my blog and Reddit to get peer reviewed/play-tested. Once we revise the system, it will then be posted on Github for the rest of development. My aim is for this to be an open, community generated system. We will take suggestions, pull requests, and even forks/deviations of this system very seriously in relation to further development.

## Player Characteristics
### Species
Species are all the possible playable creatures and variants on those.
Every species has an array of traits that can be selected to replace the standards or used to create a subspecies.
Each species is built with a standard allotted amount of Species Points (SP) that are invested in the various unique abilities of that species.
If you like to create a genetically unique member of that species or a half-breed, you can take any of the traits of the species involved as long you stay within the standard SP amount or your build respects your GM’s parameters.

### Description
For a character description, it best if you provide a short paragraph describing your character’s look, personality, and past. a list of characteristics such as height, weight, complexion, etc will also suffice if you are unable or unwilling to elaborate any further.



### Aptitudes:
#### Physical (Phy)
•    Represents physical strength & constitution
#### Agility (Agi)
•    Represents dexterity & reflex
#### Cognizance (Cog)
•    Represents perception & scrutiny
#### Acumen (Acc)
•    Represents logical reasoning & mathematical ability
#### Knowledge (Kno)
•    Represents memory & academic knowledge
#### Personality (Per)
•    Represents charisma & presence
#### Occultism (Occ)
•    Represents study of magic, alchemy, extra-sensory perception, astrology, spiritualism, religion, and/or divination depending on your setting.



#### Aptitude Rules
Aptitudes are determined by rolling [highest 2 of 4d6]/2 in a set of 7, assigning results as preferred.
Full sets may be rerolled twice (or more under GM discretion if player has statistically improbable bad luck.
The bottom line here is fun after all).



Aptitudes are used by rolling Xd6 (count 5+, explode on 6, subtract 1's)+Z, where X is the Aptitude Level & Z is the relevant Aptitude modifier.



In a Static Check, such as attempting to pick a lock, if the sum is positive, it is a success.
If it is negative, It’s a failure. If the sum is 0, roll 1d6. If the result is even, you succeed. If its odd, you fail.
The excess is used by the GM to determine how much you succeed or fail, such as getting interesting bonuses, breaking your tools, or cool descriptive flair.



In a Contested Check, such as sneaking past an enemy, you compare your sum to the opponent’s, the higher of which wins the contest.
If the sums are equal, each contestant rolls 1d6, the higher result wins.
The difference in sums is used by the GM to determine how much you won by, possibly applying interesting boons or hindrances to those involved or cool descriptive flair.



#### Specialties
Aptitudes are further broken down into Specialties, a specific focus under the umbrella of a larger aptitude, in which are an additional Xd6, where X is the Specialty Level, are added when the specialty is applied to a roll.



Every success is marked down by the player (and GM just in case).
When the character levels, Xd6 (count 5+, explode on 6) are rolled for each aptitude, X being the number of successful uses of the aptitude.
You get 1 Proficiency Point (PP) for each result 5+, which may be used to do 3 things: invest in a new Specialty or increase the level of an existing one, increase that aptitude level, or gain a new skill.
Players do not have to expend all of their Proficiency Points immediately, but may only use them when leveling.



#### Skills
In ARP, skills are what most systems call class abilities.
Though rather than being part of a single class, they are tied to a specific Aptitude and are purchased with that Aptitude’s Proficiency Points.
Any combination of skills may be added to your character (some exceptions apply), but you will become weak if you spread yourself out too much, too fast.
So it’s beneficial to start with a theme/archetype to keep yourself focused and include adaptations as needed throughout game progression.
(Skills will come in different setting modules for different genres as game design continues.)




#### Hit Points
Hit points are comprised of 2 separate pools;
* Flesh: the physical constraints of your body, measured by just Physical,
* Grit: your growing ability to avoid and respond to damage, measured by Agility + Knowledge.
While easier to obtain, Grit can be bypassed by certain special attacks.
Making it an effective yet risky method of increasing survivability.



#### Experience
Experience is gained by successes on an Aptitude Check, completing story relevant objectives, creative thinking, teamwork, and excellent roleplay.



### Kismet
The Kismet economy is designed to give players the ability to nudge the stories narrative in a direction beneficial to them.
Players may expend kismet to reroll dice of their choice, ask a reroll for NPC hoping to get a worse result, suggest a narrative, avoid death, or simply have the most auspicious outcome of a predicament they are in.
If the GM Doesn’t accept the narrative change or denies the reroll, the player retains their luck.
Though flat out denial should only be when the suggestion notably detracts from the plot, is abusing the mechanic, or overly unfair to other players.
This should be a group discussion, not a ruling of the all powerful GM.
Arguably being the writer/creator of the story, the GM retains the right to veto the decision, though this is usually bad form as you are not listening to what your table wants and likely making the experience less fun.
Just don’t be a dick about it and you should be fine.



### Combat
Combat is turn based, the order of play being decided by an Agility check.
Ties are broken by rolling 1d6 each, the higher of which chooses whether they go first or second.
Combat is comprised of contested attack (Melee=Physical, Ranged=Agility) & defense (Agility) checks. When attacking, roll Physical Dice (+ applicable Specialties) + Weapon Dice + Size Modifier and then add your Physical Modifier to the sum.
When defending roll Agility Dice (+ applicable Specialties) + Armor Dice + Size Modifier and then add your Agility Modifier to the sum.
You hit if your check sum is larger than theirs, the difference between the two being the amount of damage dice you roll



#### Armor




#### Weapons
